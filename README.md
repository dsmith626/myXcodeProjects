# Concentration

Concentration is a matching game. A grid of cards is displayed on the screen, all asigned random emoji values. When a card is clicked, it is flipped, and the emoji value assigned to that card is displayed. Each card has a sister card with the same emoji. If a card is clicked and its sister card is clicked immediately after, both cards will disapear from the screen. The objective of the game is to remove all cards from the screen in as little clicks as possible.
