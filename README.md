# My Xcode Projects
Some xcode projects I have made. 

# Concentration

Concentration is a matching game. A grid of cards is displayed on the screen, all asigned random emoji values. When a card is clicked, it is flipped, and the emoji value assigned to that card is displayed. Each card has a sister card with the same emoji value. If a card is clicked and its sister card is clicked immediately after, both cards will disapear from the screen. The objective of the game is to remove all cards from the screen in as little clicks as possible.

# Bullseye

Bullseye is a game of precision. The objective of the game is to move the slider to a position proportional to a specified number; 0 being the far left and 100 being the far right. In addition to the standard gameplay, there is also an exact mode. In exact mode, you must move the slider to the exact number position as opposed to standard mode where you can be within a range.
